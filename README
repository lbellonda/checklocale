Check Properties Maven Mojo

  The checklocale plugin is used to check if localizations stored in properties files stored in folders contain the same keys and no
  duplicate exist.
  Given a set of folders, subfolders are scanned to extract the keys.
  The expected folder structure is as follows:

  localizations
     |
     |
     +--en_US
     |       |
     |       + strings.properties
     |       + errors.properties
     |
     +--it_IT
            |
            + strings.properties
            + errors.properties
            
  Files with the same name will be compared in en_US and it_IT subfolders.
  
  The goal is checklocale and a sample usage is outlined here:
  
  			<plugin>
				<groupId>checklocale-maven-plugin</groupId>
				<artifactId>checklocale</artifactId>
				<version>CURRENT_VERSION</version>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id>one</id>
						<goals>
							<goal>checklocale</goal>
						</goals>
						<configuration>
							<encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
							<directories>
								<directory>src/main/resources/locale</directory>
							</directories>
						</configuration>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
