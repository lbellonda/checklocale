${project.name}

  The checklocale plugin is used to check if localizations stored in properties files stored in folders contain the same keys and no
  duplicate exists.
  Given a set of folders, subfolders are scanned to extract the keys.
  The expected folder structure is as follows:

+-----
localizations
     |
     |
     +--en_US
     |       |
     |       + strings.properties
     |       + errors.properties
     |
     +--it_IT
            |
            + strings.properties
            + errors.properties
+------

  Files with the same name will be compared in en_US and it_IT subfolders.
  There is the possibility to configure the plugin to report errors as warnings, to avoid blocking the build.
  The input structure will be rewritten in the output folder normalized, so in case of errors the correct configuration can be 
  rebuilt with minimal effort, using the files from a given locale taken as reference. If there are duplicated items in a file
  the last item will be retained and the other ones transformed in comments, unless the item is equal to the correspnding item
  of the base locale (the item is assumed to be untraslated). The missing items are inserted at the end of the file, where they can be easily checked. The value of the missing item is taken from the base locale, if the base locale contains it, or, if not existing in the base locale, from the first of the other locales (taken in casual order) that contains it.
  
  The plugin uses the syntax of property files for Java and Flex, but can be conditioned to recognize only the most common
  form (use of equals sign as separator between key and value).

* Goals Overview

  * checklocale: this goal executed in the compile phase will check the locale files.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}. Some more
  specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally contribute
  additional examples, tips or errata to the
