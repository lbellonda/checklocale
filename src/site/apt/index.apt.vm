${project.name}

  The checklocale plugin is used to check if localizations stored in properties files stored in folders contain the same keys and no
  duplicate exist.
  Given a set of folders, subfolders are scanned to extract the keys.
  The expected folder structure is as follows:

+-----
localizations
     |
     |
     +--en_US
     |       |
     |       + strings.properties
     |       + errors.properties
     |
     +--it_IT
            |
            + strings.properties
            + errors.properties
+------

  Files with the same name will be compared in en_US and it_IT subfolders.
