Basic usage

  Create an "execution", then set the goal to "checklocale". In the configuration you can specify one optional encoding and
  a list of directories to check. Default encoding is UTF-8. An optional parameter, errors, boolean, can be used to get the report of the errors without stopping the build.

  
  Here a sample of the configuration
  
+----
<executions>
  <execution>
   <id>one</id>
    <goals>
      <goal>checklocale</goal>
    </goals>
     <configuration>
    	<encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
    	<baseLocale>en_US</baseLocale>
    	<directories>
    		<directory>src/main/resources/locale</directory>
    		<directory>optional/folder2</directory>
    		<directory>optional/folder3</directory>
    	</directories>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
+-----

Minimal configuration
  The following is a sample of minimal configuration, only folders and goal are required, other parameter assume predefined values:
  
+----
<executions>
  <execution>
   <id>one</id>
    <goals>
      <goal>checklocale</goal>
    </goals>
     <configuration>
    	<directories>
    		<directory>src/main/resources/locale</directory>
    	</directories>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
+-----

Listing errors as warnings

  To reports errors as warnings use this configuration (note the "errors" parameter):

+----
<executions>
  <execution>
   <id>one</id>
    <goals>
      <goal>checklocale</goal>
    </goals>
     <configuration>
     	<errors>false</errors>
    	<encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
    	<directories>
    		<directory>src/main/resources/locale</directory>
    		<directory>optional/folder2</directory>
    		<directory>optional/folder3</directory>
    	</directories>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>

Configuring Plugin
  
  The following configuration can be applied to modify the plugin behavior:
  
  * set the base locale,
  * use a specific encoding for file reading and writing,
  * skip the rewrite phase,
  * set the output folder,
  * use the stricter syntax,
  * avoid to emit errors,
  * allow to embed locale code in file names.
