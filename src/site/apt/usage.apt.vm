Configuring Plugin

  Create an "execution", then set the goal to "checklocale". In the configuration you can specify one optional encoding and
  a list of directories to check. Default encoding is UTF-8.

  Here a sample of the configuration


+----
<executions>
  <execution>
   <id>one</id>
    <goals>
      <goal>checklocale</goal>
    </goals>
     <configuration>
    	<encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
    	<directories>
    		<directory>src/main/resources/locale</directory>
    		<directory>optional/folder2</directory>
    		<directory>optional/folder3</directory>
    	</directories>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
</executions>
